    <h1>Welcome to my Portfolio!</h1>

    <div id="introduction">
        <h2>Hi! Nice to meet you.</h2>
        <p>As an emerging UI designer, my favorite past time is creating new content in many different digital formats.
            One type of content I like to to make content is fancy Canva graphics for different special events
            or holidays.
            My next two favorites are creating Interface designs with Figma or websites with code. I hope you enjoy this
            portfolio I put together with Code to showcase my work.</p>

    <h2>Experience and Education</h2>
    <p>I've earned my Bachelor's in Strategic Communication- Social Media Management from Liberty University Online.
        After I graduated, I enrolled in a UI design bootcamp known as CareerFoundry. Here I learned all about Interface
        Design and even a little code. Directly after finishing, I enrolled in a Full Stack Web Development course
        through CodeAcademy. As for the experience side of things, I practiced my design skills through volunteering
        with a couple of different non-profits called Yiddishland California and Dallas Pets Alive. Now I'm excited to
        work twords obtaining my first design position.</p>
